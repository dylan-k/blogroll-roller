PHP Script for RSS auto-discovery and OPML file generation. Forked from @skinofstars at http://skinofstars.com/2010/03/php-script-rss-auto-discovery-opml-file/

## Instructions for Use

The purpose of this script is to help you grab all the RSS feeds from a list of blogs. This can help you to subscribe to those feeds in a batch, without having to do a lot of looky-looky clicky-clicky. The script will output all the RSS feeds it finds into one OPML file, which you can import into your favorite feed reader to add all the blogs to your reader. (Feedly and Digg Reader are just two examples of feed readers.)

1. make a text file named URLlist.txt
2. fill the text file the the URLS of blogs you'd like to follow, one URL per line
3. put URLlist.txt and index.php in the same directory on your server
4. run index.php
5. profit!

If you have any questions about this, please use the Github Issues and I'll try to help you out. I'm not the original author of this, but I'll do my best.
